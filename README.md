SimpleChat Test iOS App


This is my SimpleChat app for my test task for Faifly

-realized oportunity to chat for two people

-added autorization, delete your message option and pull to refresh data

In my app i used Firebase to store and get data for my chat, because Firebase is simple realtime database what 
exactly i neded to simulate work of real chat application.
Also i used SCLAlertView to deny sending messages while message field is empty and using application without enterin 
a propper user name.
SwipeCellKit used in my app to provide delete option with design that suits to design of the rest of app.
Design in app made with Xcode Main.storyboard.

It is my first made application at all, so familliar for me were only Xcode and Swift themselves.
But actually most of problemes were connected to simple bugs i faced during the development process.

Amount of time spent to develop app is ten days.
